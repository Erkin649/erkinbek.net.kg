                <p className="paragraph"><span>The relevance of research.</span> The problem of old
                age is relevant not only for the elderly, but also for the whole
                society. Age is an important characteristic for every person.
                Worthy old age in many respects depends on a personâ€™s efforts
                for self-development throughout his life and his cultural level.
                International Day of Older Persons is celebrated on October 1st.
                The purpose of the Day of Older Persons is to draw attention to the
                problems and needs of the elderly, to maintain their sense of need
                for society, to increase public awareness of the demographic aging
                of society. In the Kyrgyz Republic over the past 5 years, the number
                above working age has increased by 18 percent. According to the definition
                of the National Statistical Committee and the Ministry of Social Development
                and Labor, men 63 and older than 63 years old, and women 58 and older than
                58 years old is considered an elderly person. The gap between the female
                and male sex is explained by the fact that the probability of surviving
                to retirement age in women is more than men. And also take into account
                the retirement age of women comes five years earlier (for men - at 63 years
                old, for women - at 58 years old). Modern 60-year-old women are more likely
                to live on average about 20 years, men - about 15 years. In 2016, life
                expectancy for men was 67.0 years, for women - 75.1 years. For the existence
                of such social phenomena, some arguments are due to a related factor directly
                affecting human life. This may be alcoholism, smoking, patterns of aging
                or accidents. Gerontologists have not come to a single conclusion that heredity
                or the environment is more important? Heredity plays a big role, but the external
                environment is more important than the genetic component of the body.</p> <br />
                    
                <p className="paragraph"><span>The purpose of the research.</span> The purpose

                comfortable he feels. And also to get more specific information for
                processing and analyzing the current situation.To improve the quality
                of life, I need to evaluate the current situation using certain parameters.

                to improve the quality of social services.</p><hr />
